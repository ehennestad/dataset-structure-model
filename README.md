# Dataset Structure Model

A declarative schema and framework for describing the structure of scientific datasets, capturing both their physical layout on disk and their semantic organization. The model enables formal definitions of file and folder conventions, entity hierarchies (e.g., subjects, sessions), metadata extraction rules, and environment-specific storage configurations. It supports standardized representation and access to heterogeneous datasets, whether flat or hierarchical, to facilitate interoperability, automation, and reproducibility across tools and research workflows.
