Problem:
- non-standardized, highly heterogeneous data organization
- highly heterogeneous and non-standardized folder structures


Goal:
- Design a schema and framework for formally describing **how** a dataset is structured
  - Folder organization and file naming conventions (physical layout on disk)
  - Logical grouping of files by entities (e.g., subjects, sessions, etc.) (semantic organization)
  - Rules for extracting metadata from paths (metadata-aware)
  - Environment-specific storage configurations


This will allow tools or pipelines to understand and operate on datasets regardless of how the data is actually laid out on disk.
In other words, the DatasetStructureModel defines a metadata-aware, declarative abstraction over messy, real-world datasets.

standardized semantic model over arbitrary folder structures.
